# RNA-seq-data-analysis-on-Epipedobates-frogs

### Project goal
The genus of poison dart frogs Epipedobates, native to Columbia and Ecuador, are known to sequester alkaloids into their skin, which act as a chemical defense against predators. However, there are species of Epipedobates RNA-sequencing (Tag-Seq), and compared levels of gene expression within and across species
